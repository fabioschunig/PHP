## SOAP vs Direct Requests

Using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) instead of making direct requests to the server can offer several advantages, depending on the project's context. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Structure and Standards**: SOAP is a well-defined protocol that follows strict standards. This facilitates interoperability between different systems and platforms.

2. **Security**: SOAP supports WS-Security, allowing for authentication and encryption, making communication more secure compared to direct requests.

3. **Transactions**: SOAP provides support for complex transactions, allowing coordination of multiple operations that need to be treated as a single unit of work.

4. **Structured Messages**: SOAP messages are sent in a well-structured XML format, which makes data processing and validation easier.

5. **Web Service Compatibility**: Many organizations use SOAP to expose APIs as web services, allowing different systems to integrate easily.

6. **RPC Support**: SOAP can be used for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), making it easier to invoke methods on a remote server as if they were local.

7. **WSDL**: The use of WSDL (Web Services Description Language) allows clients to automatically discover available operations and expected data types, facilitating development.

However, itâ€™s important to note that in many cases, REST (Representational State Transfer) is preferred for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and better support for JSON, especially in modern web applications. 
The choice between SOAP and direct server requests (or REST) should be based on the specific needs of your project.
